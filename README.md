# Senior Civil Service Appraisals

## Authentication

Authentication requires two environment variables. You can obtain these by
visiting the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
and selecting **APIs & auth** from the sidebar, followed by **Credentials**,
then **Create new Client ID**.

Set `GPLUS_CLIENT_ID` to the value of **Client ID** and `GPLUS_CLIENT_SECRET`
to **Client secret**.

You will also need to configure **Consent screen** below for logging in to work.

The permitted domains are configured in `config/application.rb`.
