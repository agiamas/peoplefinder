Hello <%= @recipient_name %>,

360° feedback is vital to developing performance in line with our
leadership model and the Ministry of Justice story.

Your colleague <%= @subject_name %> has sent you this message, asking
for feedback:

<%= @invitation_message %>

You can respond using the SCS 360* Appraisals online service.

Your feedback should cover any interactions with them at work over the
course of the performance year.

To use the service you need to click on this link:

<%= token_url(@token) %>

The link replaces the password system and you’ll always need to use it
to log in. We recommend you save this email to access the link in
future.

If you feel unable to give feedback you can decline the request, giving
a clear and reasonable explanation why.

Your response should be submitted by <%= date(ReviewPeriod.closes_at) %>.

Feedback will be in your name, not anonymous.

What to expect

Once you’re logged in to the system, you need to answer a series of
questions about work. You will use a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = poor; 5 =
good) to give your feedback answers.

You will also see some optional questions asking you to give more
detailed comments and observations about the person and their work.

When giving examples please focus on ‘what’ they did and ‘how’.

Further guidance

Find out more about giving feedback on page 6 of ‘How to obtain and
share constructive feedback’.

If you want to see guidance on types of behaviours considered ‘good’ and
‘poor’, refer to the Civil Service Competency Framework.
