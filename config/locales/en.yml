# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      Welcome to the SCS 360° Appraisals. This online service supports the SCS
      performance management system.

      This tool makes it easier for you to:

      * request feedback on your direct reports
      * monitor progress of feedback requests
      * ask for feedback on your performance
      * view feedback on yourself

      Feedback is **not** anonymous.

        The CSV file you upload should have a header row with these columns:

        * `name`
        * `email`
        * `job_title`
        * `manager_email`

        The manager email address, where supplied, is used to determine hierarchy.

        Uploading a file multiple times will not create duplicate users.
        Names of existing users will be updated (using the email address as the
        identifier), as will management relationships.
